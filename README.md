# Bank_Customer_Churn_prediction

Bank Customer Churn Prediction aims to identify which customers are likely to leave the bank, using patterns from historical data. In this project, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is employed to make predictions, as it is effective at finding the optimal boundary between customers who stay and those who churn. However, since churn cases are often much fewer than non-churn cases, techniques like Random Over Sampling (ROS) and Random Under Sampling (RUS) are used to balance the dataset. ROS increases the number of churn cases by duplicating existing examples, while RUS reduces the number of non-churn cases by randomly removing some. These techniques help the SVM model learn more effectively from a balanced dataset, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions about customer churn.
